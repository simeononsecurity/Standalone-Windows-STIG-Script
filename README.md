**Download all the required files from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/Standalone-Windows-STIG-Script)**

**Note:** This script should work for most, if not all, systems without issue. While [@SimeonOnSecurity](https://github.com/simeononsecurity) creates, reviews, and tests each repo intensively, we can not test every possible configuration nor does [@SimeonOnSecurity](https://github.com/simeononsecurity) take any responsibility for breaking your system. If something goes wrong, be prepared to submit an [issue](../../issues). Do not run this script if you don't understand what it does. It is your responsibility to review and test the script before running it.

## Ansible:
We now offer a playbook collection for this script. Please see the following:
- [Github Repo](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/Windows_STIG_Ansible)
- [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/simeononsecurity/windows_stigs)

## Docker:
We test this script using an automated docker container
- [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/simeononsecurity/standalone-windows-stig)

## Introduction:

Windows is insecure operating system out of the box and requires many changes to insure [FISMA](https://www.cisa.gov/federal-information-security-modernization-act) compliance. 
Organizations like [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), [Cyber.mil](https://public.cyber.mil), the [Department of Defense](https://dod.gov), and the [National Security Agency](https://www.nsa.gov/) have recommended and required configuration changes to lockdown, harden, and secure the operating system and ensure government compliance. These changes cover a wide range of mitigations including blocking telemetry, macros, removing bloatware, and preventing many physical attacks on a system.

Standalone systems are some of the most difficult and annoying systems to secure. When not automated, they require manual changes of each STIG/SRG. Totalling over 1000 configuration changes on a typical deployment and an average of 5 minutes per change equaling 3.5 days worth of work. This script aims to speed up that process significantly.

## Notes: 

- This script is designed for operation in **Enterprise** environments and assumes you have hardware support for all the requirements.
  - For personal systems please see this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/Windows-Optimize-Harden-Debloat)
- This script is not designed to bring a system to 100% compliance, rather it should be used as a stepping stone to complete most, if not all, the configuration changes that can be scripted. 
  - Minus system documentation, this collection should bring you up to about 95% compliance on all the STIGS/SRGs applied.

## Editing policies in Local Group Policy after the fact:
- Import the ADMX Policy definitions from this [repo](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/STIG-Compliant-Domain-Prep/tree/master/Files/PolicyDefinitions) into *C:\windows\PolicyDefinitions* on the system you're trying to modify.
- Open ```gpedit.msc``` on on the system you're trying to modify. 


## How to run the script:
### Automated Install:
The script may be launched from the extracted GitHub download like this:
```powershell
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://simeononsecurity.ch/scripts/standalonewindows.ps1'))
```
**Note**: *This installation version installs all of the configurations. If you seek to customize it, please use the [Manual Install](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/Standalone-Windows-STIG-Script#manual-install)*

### Chocolatey Install:
Assuming you have [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) installed. You may install this script via the following command:
```powershell
choco install standalone-windows-stig
```
Or view the package on the [Chocolatey Repo](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/Standalone-Windows-STIG).

**Note**: *The Chocolatey version of this script may lag behind this repo by multiple major versions. We update it sparingly, but stably. Additionally, this version will install all of the configurations. If you seek to customize it, please use the [Manual Install](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/Standalone-Windows-STIG-Script#manual-install)*

### Manual Install:
If manually downloaded, the script must be launched from the directory containing all the other files from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/simeononsecurity/Standalone-Windows-STIG-Script)

All of the parameters in the "secure-standalone.ps1" script are optional, with a default value of $true. This means that if no value is specified for a parameter when the script is run, it will be treated as if it were set to $true.

The script takes the following parameters, all of which are optional and default to $true if not specified:

- **cleargpos**: (Boolean) Clear GPOs not being used
- **installupdates**: (Boolean) Install updates and reboot if necessary
- **adobe**: (Boolean) STIG Adobe Reader
- **firefox**: (Boolean) STIG Firefox
- **chrome**: (Boolean) STIG Chrome
- **IE11**: (Boolean) STIG Internet Explorer 11
- **edge**: (Boolean) STIG Edge
- **dotnet**: (Boolean) STIG .NET Framework
- **office**: (Boolean) STIG Office
- **onedrive**: (Boolean) STIG OneDrive
- **java**: (Boolean) STIG Java
- **windows**: (Boolean) STIG Windows
- **defender**: (Boolean) STIG Windows Defender
- **firewall**: (Boolean) STIG Windows Firewall
- **mitigations**: (Boolean) STIG Mitigations
- **nessusPID**: (Boolean) Resolve Unquoted Strings in Path
- **horizon**: (Boolean) STIG VMware Horizon

An example of how to run the script with all default parameters would be:

```powershell
.\secure-standalone.ps1
```
If you want to specify a different value for one or more of the parameters, you can include them in the command along with their desired value. For example, if you wanted to run the script and set the $firefox parameter to $false, the command would be:

```powershell
.\secure-standalone.ps1 -firefox $false
```

You can also specify multiple parameters in the command like this:

```powershell
.\secure-standalone.ps1 -firefox $false -chrome $false
```
Note that in this example, both the Firefox and Chrome parameters are set to $false.
